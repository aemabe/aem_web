I am a Senior at UNC Chapel Hill majoring in Biology and Statistics with a minor in Data-science. After graduation, I plan on attending a Masters program to further my education in these subjects. A few of my research interests include Bayesian Statistics, Marathon Running, Visualization, and Decision Science.

I have proficient experience in both R and Python coding languages. Over the summers of 2023 and 2024, I interned for UCB Biosciences as a Benefit Risk Analysis Intern, and I will return to intern with UCB in the summer of 2025 as a Biostatistician intern. At UNC Chapel Hill, I am a member of Tri Beta, Alpha phi Omega, and the Sports Analysis Intelligence Laboratory.
